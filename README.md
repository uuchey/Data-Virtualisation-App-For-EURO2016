# EURO2016
Data Visualization App for EURO 2016 results based on Betfair probability data

This is a coding excercise which creates a probability tree showing the probability distribution for the European Championships winner from the knockout stages.

The data and odds of each team reaching each round/winning the tournament was extracted and cleaned from Betfair a day before the knockout stage began: 24/06/2016.

The implied probabilities of the teams reaching each round / winning the tournament was calculated in a python script.

D3 has been used to create an interactive tree map of teams with their probability data.

When you hover over a team, it highlights their possible route to the final with probabilities displayed for reaching each round.

Likewise, if you hover over a fixture / the winner, it should show the most likely team(s) to reach that fixture / be the winner.
